# nachiketansingh-Led_blinking_speed_using_potentiometer_ARDUINO


  I made a small LED project in which there are 10 LED whose blinking speed varies using potentiometer(with the help of ARDUINO uno)
  the real world example of this project is , many car have indicator which also work on this principle.
  (I built this project on 26 April 2025 on online software TINKERCAD, and it took me just 2.5 hours to complete. At the time, I was just starting out with Arduino.)



i build a Chrome Dinosaur Game 🦖 , but here is a twist i put the servo motor on my space bar of the keyboard and connect it with the Joystick 🕹️ .
Chrome Dinosaur Game 🦖 is being displayed on the screen .As i pressed the joystick🕹️ ,servo motor will rotate 60 degree on a spacebar( spacebar is got pressed) servo will hit the spacebar and our dinosour will jump.

Microcontroller that i have used is Arduino Nano.
