# Led_blinking_speed_using_potentiometer_ARDUINO


  I made a small LED ðŸ’¡ project in which there are 10 LED whose blinking speed varies using potentiometer(with the help of ARDUINO uno)
  the real world example of this project is , many car have indicator which also work on this principle.
  
  (I built this project on 26 April 2025 on online software name called "TINKERCAD", and it took me just 2.5 hours to complete. At the time, I was just starting out with Arduino.)
